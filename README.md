# UAV-Object-Detection

The dataset provided for this part of the assignment contains images of 314 UAVs of different types, in different environments and zoom settings. Each image has a corresponding text file containing the information on the localisation of the UAV in the image, this was already done by manual labelling and will be treated as the ground truth bounding boxes (BB). The objective is to train a model to predict the localisation of the drones and verify the accuracy of the predictions against the ground truth.
